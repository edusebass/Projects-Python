# /*
# Iterator in Python is an object that is used to iterate over iterable objects like lists, tuples, dicts, and sets. 
# The iterator object is initialized using the iter() method. It uses the next() method for iteration.

# __iter__(): The iter() method is called for the initialization of an iterator. This returns an iterator object
# __next__(): The next method returns the next value for the iterable. When we use a for loop to traverse any iterable object, internally it uses the iter() method 
#   to get an iterator object, which further uses the next() method to iterate over. This method raises a StopIteration to signal the end of the iteration.
